# Skin_cancer_detection
The skin cancer detection project using CNN and GAN is an AI-based system that aims to identify and classify skin cancer from images. 
It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic skin cancer images.
Overall, the skin cancer detection project using CNN and GAN offers an efficient and effective solution for early detection and classification of skin cancer, potentially aiding medical professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses.
